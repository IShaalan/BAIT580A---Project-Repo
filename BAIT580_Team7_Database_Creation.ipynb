    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook is to address milestone one of the BAIT580A Course project for team 7. The project team is seeking to establish the relationship between education quality and the socioeconomic indicators in an effort to encourage policy makers to increase the budget expenditure on education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions:\n",
    "- Does the education expenditure as a % of the GDP correlate with increase in quality of education?\n",
    "- Does the increase in the quality of education improve social and economical welfare of people (HDI Index)?*\n",
    "- Do scores in international standardized tests (ex. PISA, TIMMS) provide a good indicator of the quality of education?*\n",
    "- Does the increase in the quality of education result in an increase in the living standards of the people (GDP)?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this milestone, we are loading the acquired datasets as outlined in the sources, creating the data dictionary, database design, and creating the schema and database in postgresql.  "
